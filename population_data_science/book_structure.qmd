abstract: |
  In this chapter, we delve into the transformation of microfinance institutions in Africa and its ramifications for the future of banking. The transition of Microfinance Institutions from the non-profit NGO model to the commercial model, along with the entry of Fintech firms and telecommunication companies into the financial sector, poses a significant threat to the conventional banking model. This shift results in market segmentation, leading to heightened competition in the middle and lower segments. Consequently, this competition holds the potential to enhance financial services for those who have been excluded from the system. Moreover, we anticipate a surge in collaboration between microfinance institutions and traditional banks, and even the possibility of commercial banks acquiring microfinance institutions. To tap into the microfinance market, commercial banks are likely to augment their risk assessment criteria by embracing techniques such as group lending. This evolving banking landscape aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, it is imperative to reevaluate the regulatory framework to adapt to the rapidly evolving banking architecture.
