# Population Data Science
The science of data about people as a combination of two fields of **data science** and **population science**.
Welcome to the "Population Data Science" repository!

## Roadmap
This repository is dedicated to the study of population data and its applications in various fields. Here, you will find a collection of resources, tools, and methodologies related to population studies, demography, and related disciplines.

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and accessible resource for researchers, students, and anyone interested in understanding human populations and their dynamics. Whether you are exploring fertility patterns, analyzing health outcomes, or studying labor markets, this repository aims to support your journey in population data science.

Within this repository, you will find a diverse range of materials, including datasets, code examples, research papers, and tutorials. We encourage you to explore, contribute, and engage with the community of population data scientists.

We believe that by fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, we can advance our understanding of human populations and contribute to evidence-based decision-making in areas such as public policy, healthcare, and social sciences.

Thank you for joining us in this exciting exploration of population data science. Together, we can uncover valuable insights and make meaningful contributions to the field.

Happy exploring! The Population Data Science Repository Team.
